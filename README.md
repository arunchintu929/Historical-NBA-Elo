# Historical-NBA-Elo
The NBA Elo dataset spans from 1946 to 2015, providing a comprehensive historical record of NBA game statistics and outcomes.
Each row in the dataset corresponds to a single game and includes variables such as team IDs, franchise IDs, points scored, Elo ratings, and game location.
The dataset comprises 126,315 rows and 22 columns, offering a rich source of data for research and analysis.
Variables like "elo_i" and "elo_n" represent a team's Elo rating before and after a game, providing insights into team performance over time.
The "game_location" variable categorizes games as home (H), away (A), or neutral (N), enabling analysis of home-court advantage and away game performance.
"Forecast" provides Elo-based predictions of team success, allowing for comparison with actual game results.
The dataset's industry context includes sports research, fantasy sports, team management, broadcasting, fan engagement, and marketing.
Research questions aim to leverage the dataset to predict game outcomes accurately and investigate potential home-court advantages or away-game disadvantages.
Hypotheses suggest that incorporating Elo ratings and past performance data can improve the accuracy of game outcome predictions.
Another hypothesis examines the existence of an "away game disadvantage" in the NBA, positing that certain teams consistently underperform when playing away from home.
Analyzing team Elo ratings across different game locations can provide insights into teams' relative strengths and weaknesses in varying environments.
By testing these hypotheses, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of factors influencing NBA game outcomes and team performance dynamics.
Statistical analysis of historical data can inform strategic decisions for team management, coaching strategies, and sports betting.
The dataset's extensive coverage and granularity make it a valuable resource for basketball enthusiasts, analysts, and researchers.
Understanding the dataset's variables and context is crucial for interpreting findings accurately and drawing meaningful conclusions about NBA performance trends.
